Go to the Revolut Business web app [settings](https://business.revolut.com/settings) → **APIs** → **Business API**.\n  2. Select the corresponding API certificate.\n  3. In **Production IP whitelist**, provide the IP(s) which should be whitelisted, and save.     \n  :::\n\nTo configure your JWT and obtain the refresh and first access tokens, complete the following steps:\n\n  1.
