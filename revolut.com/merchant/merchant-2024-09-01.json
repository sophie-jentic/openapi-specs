Whether you're a startup, a growing business, or an established enterprise in the e-commerce industry, our API helps you streamline your operations.\n\nAs a Revolut Business customer with a Merchant Account, you can use the\nMerchant API to leverage the following features:\n\n- [Order management](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/orders)\n- [Customer management](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/customers)\n- [Payment management](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/payments)\n- [Payout management](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/payouts)\n- [Dispute management](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/disputes)\n- [Reporting analytics](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/report-runs)\n- [Webhook management](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/webhooks)\n- [Location management](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/locations)\n\n... and more.\n\n### API versions\n\n:::caution\nWe highly recommend using versioning in your API calls. If you don't provide a version header on the operations where it's required, you will receive an error response.\n:::\n\nThe Merchant API uses request header versioning. Where it is required you need to use the `Revolut-Api-Version` header parameter to specify an API version. Each request, where it is indicated in the API specification, must contain a version header in the following format:\n  \n```\n'Revolut-Api-Version: 2024-09-01'\n```\n\n:::info\nFor more information, see: [API versions](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/api-versions)\n:::\n\n### Test the Merchant API\n\nYou can test the Merchant API in Postman by forking this collection:\n\n[![View in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://www.postman.com/revolut-api/workspace/revolut-developers/overview)",

Designed to streamline order processing, this resource encapsulates a suite of operations that allow for efficiently handling order management-related tasks. For more information about the order lifecycle, see: [Order and payment lifecycle](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/accept-payments/other-resources/order-payment-flow).\n\nThese operations are equipped to handle various order management scenarios, providing a robust interface for businesses to interact with their order data. \n\nTo process a payment related to your customers' purchases, you need to create an `Order` object. Then you can use an order's unique `token` to process and accept payments via the Revolut Checkout Widget.\n\n:::caution\nThe [Create an order endpoint](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/create-order) was updated to a new version and now returns `token` as the public identifier for the order. Previous integrations might still use the deprecated endpoint returning `public_id`.\n\nWe strongly advise upgrading to the new [Create an order endpoint](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/create-order).\n:::"

      "description": "The Customers resource in the Merchant API is a pivotal tool for tracking and managing customer-related transactions within your e-commerce or retail platform. This resource provides a structured approach to customer management, enabling you to maintain a consistent record of customer transactions.\n\nA `Customer` object can be created using the [Create a customer](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/create-customer) endpoint and you can then retrieve, update and delete a customer using its `id`. `Customer` objects enable you to track multiple transactions in your system associated with the same customer in the Merchant API.\n\nYou can save and store payment methods of a customer in the `payment_method` object, for more information, see: [Charge a customer's saved payment method](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/accept-payments/tutorials/save-and-charge-payment-methods/charge-saved-payment-method). A merchant can store the details of the payment securely and group transactions from the same payment method in their system. \n\nA payment method is unique for each customer. For example, if the same card is used for a transaction by two different customers, two payment method objects are created linked to each customer.\n\nSimilar principle applies when saving payment methods via Revolut Pay for merchant initiated transaction (MIT - useful for recurring payments). If a customer saves their details through Revolut Pay for MIT in separate sessions, each session will create a new payment method object linked to the customer.\n\n:::note\nYou cannot create a payment method explicitly because they are generated as part of a payment. You can only retrieve, update or delete a payment method, or you can retrieve all payment methods of a customer.\n:::"

      "name": "Webhooks",
      "description": "A `webhook` (also called a web callback) allows your system to receive an event from a different app immediately after it happens. \n\nFor example, you can subscribe to a webhook when an order changes from `pending` to `completed` status. When the payment is cleared and the order is completed, Revolut servers send a notification to the URL of your choice. This is a more efficient way to know when an order is paid as opposed to trying to get the status of the order every few seconds.\n\nMany events that happen to a Revolut Merchant account are synchronous, which means they arrive instantly and have immediate results. For example, a successful request to create a customer immediately returns a `Customer` object. Such requests don't require webhooks.\n\nThe Revolut Merchant API supports webhooks for events including `ORDER_COMPLETED` and `ORDER_AUTHORISED`.\n\n:::note\nBecause we cannot guarantee the delivery order of the status (`events`), you might receive the status not in the expected order. Make sure that your implementation does not rely on the order that the events are being received in.\n:::\n\nFor example, for a completed order, you should receive the `ORDER_AUTHORISED` status first and then `ORDER_COMPLETED`. However, if the `ORDER_AUTHORISED` status isn't sent successfully at first, it's moved to the queue to be resent in the next few minutes. Before then, if the `ORDER_COMPLETED` status is sent successfully, you get `ORDER_COMPLETED` first and then `ORDER_AUTHORISED`.\n\nCheck out our tutorial for [Using webhooks to keep track of the payment lifecycle](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/accept-payments/tutorials/work-with-webhooks/using-webhooks).\n\n:::info\nFor more information about the order and payment lifecycle, see: [Order and payment lifecycle](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/accept-payments/other-resources/order-payment-flow).\n:::"

When the payment for an order is authorised, you can capture the order to send it to the processing stage.\n\n:::info\nFor more information about the order and payment lifecycle, see: [Order and payment\nlifecycle](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/accept-payments/other-resources/order-payment-flow).\n:::\n\n## Capture modes\n\nWhen you [create an order](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/create-order), you can choose one of the following capture modes:\n\n  | **Capture mode** | **Description** |\n  | ---------------- | --------------- |\n  | `automatic` | The order is captured automatically after payment authorisation. No further actions are needed. |\n  | `manual` | The order is not captured automatically and stays in `authorised` state. You must manually capture the order using the steps outlined below. |\n\n:::caution\nUncaptured orders remain in `authorised` state **for 7 days**. If not captured within this period, the funds are returned to the customer's original payment method.\n:::\n\n### Manual capture\n  \nTo capture an order manually, use one of the following methods:\n  \n| **Web UI** | **Merchant API** |\n| ---------- | ------------ |\n| <ol><li>Log in to your [Revolut Business portal](https://business.revolut.com).</li><li>Navigate to the **Merchant** tab on the dashboard, and click the **See all** button in the **Transactions** section.</li><li>Select an uncaptured payment, and click **Capture**.</li></ol> | Use the `/capture` endpoint. |\n\n:::info\nFor more information about manually capturing an order, see: [Authorise an amount to capture\nlater](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/guides/accept-payments/tutorials/capture-later).\n:::\n\n#### Partial capture\n \nYou have the option to capture only a fraction of the full amount. In such cases, the uncaptured portion of the amount will be voided.\n\n:::caution\nThe following limitations apply to manual captures:\n  - It's not possible to capture an amount multiple times\n  - Captured amount can't exceed the authorised amount\n  - On Web UI, only capturing full amount is possible\n  - `0` amount captures are not allowed\n  - For partial captures, you can only resend the request with the initial amount\n:::\n\n## Idempotency and repeated requests\n\nThe capture operation is idempotent. This means that an order can only be captured once. If you send a capture request more than once:\n\n- The first valid request captures the order and moves it to the processing stage.\n- Any subsequent capture requests for the same order will not recapture the funds. Instead, these requests will behave like a [Retrieve an order](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/retrieve-order) request. The response will provide the current state of the order as if you queried it using the order retrieval endpoint.\n\n:::info\nUtilising the idempotent nature of this endpoint helps maintain data consistency and prevents duplicate processing of the same order.\n:::",

Once your customer selects a shipping address, Revolut needs to validate if the merchant (or their shipping partner) delivers to the address provided. This is done by contacting the merchant's backend and asking for such validation and information.\n\nIn order for your backend to support Fast checkout, you need to:\n\n1. Register an URL to handle address validation\n1. Validate the shipping address sent to your backend\n1. Respond with a JSON object containing the result of the validation\n\nAdditionally, Revolut Pay can support multiple webhooks if you have multiple stores.

This fingerprint can be used to uniquely identify various payment methods.\n\n#### Fingerprint generation\n\n| Payment method | Description |\n| -------- | ----------- |\n| **All payment methods** | A fingerprint is generated for all payment methods, including cards, Revolut Pay (card, account-to-account payments), Apple Pay, and Google Pay. |\n| **Cards (Revolut Pay & Card Gateway)** | For cards, the fingerprint is based on the PAN. Cards processed via Revolut Pay and our card gateway will share the same fingerprint. Renewed cards (new expiry/CVV) retain the same fingerprint for efficient blocking. |\n| **Apple Pay & Google Pay** | Since Apple Pay and Google Pay provide us Device PANs (DPAN), the fingerprint is based on the DPAN provided by Apple/Google, not the connected card's PAN. This means that a new DPAN (and fingerprint) is generated for cards in case they are re-added to the customer's digital wallet, or added to different devices. |\n\n#### Detecting duplicate payment methods\n\nFingerprints are a valuable tool for detecting duplicate payment methods by identifying if a payment method has been seen before. This capability, in turn, helps in preventing various types of misuse (e.g., exploitation of free trials, or association with known problematic accounts, which can be a form of fraud). To effectively use fingerprints for this purpose, you will need to create and maintain your own lists (e.g., blocklists of known problematic fingerprints, allowlists for trusted customers, or tracking frequently used fingerprints). \n\nThe ideal way to utilise fingerprints is by combining them with a manual capture process. While automatic capture with subsequent refunds for problematic payments is possible, manual capture based on fingerprint validation is recommended.\n\nDuring your manual capture workflow, after a payment was authorised:\n  \n  - Check the fingerprint status by comparing it against your maintained lists and internal business rules.\n  - If you decide to proceed with the payment (e.g., the fingerprint is not on a blocklist, or matches a trusted customer's previous payment method): [Capture the order](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/capture-order).\n  - If you decide not to proceed with the payment (e.g., the fingerprint matches a known fraudulent fingerprint, or exhibits suspicious patterns): [Cancel the order](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/cancel-order)."
