      In the request, this signifies that these pieces of information are required.
      In the response, these flags indicate this information has been given to the
      best of your ability, there is not another call which will provide better information.

      <br ><br >

      | Scenario | Requested Flag | Acceptable Response Flag | Explanation and expectations

      -----------|----------------|--------------------------|------------

      |1      |False     |False     |Partner is responding with the exact set of data
      being requested.

      |2      |False     |True      |Partner is capable of responding with more data
      than what was asked in the request. This may be useful in case a Partner''s
      system does not allow you split content per the TripAdvisor requirements.

      |3      |True      |True      |Partner is providing the required pieces of information
      to the best of their knowledge. Best case, Partner provides all the content
      requested.

      |4      |True      |False     |Partner cannot provide this information at this
      time, either due to an error in the partner''s system / load capabilities. TripAdvisor
      may be unable to display the rest of your content.


      Example: in a single hotel request with all flags set to false - i.e TA is requesting
      at least one room-rate to be returned (assuming there is availability for that
      hotel). Potential response options:

      1. At minimum we expect to receive a single room-rate with the response flags
      set to all be false.

      2. However, for the same request, a Partner is permitted to send TA more information.
      For example, Partner can potentially send all room-rates (instead of just one)
      for that hotel. Here a Partner is expected to set the "multiple_room_rates_included"
      to "true"


      Example: the request has flags for "room_type_details" and "photos" set to "true.
      Acceptable responses where Partner sets "room_type_details" and "photos" flag
      to "true"

      1. Partner provides photos for each room type

      2. It is possible that the partner just does not have access to / full coverage
      for the content being requested. It is expected that the response flags for
      "photos" and "room_type_details" are set to "true" but the payload returned
      may not contain any photos. Partner is indicating that they understand the requested
      fields, are trying to provide that data to us, and there is no better content
      available in a separate call or otherwise


      Responses should include as much extra information as they can without incurring
      significant costs in time the call takes or rate of calls supported. If any
      of these fields are missing they will be interpreted as false. New flags may
      be added in the future in which case they should either not be returned or returned
      as false.

          TripAdvisor requires a credit or debit card at time of booking not only
          to support a hotel''s guarantee policy but also to reduce fraud. In the
          case where a hotel does not require a credit or debit card guarantee, it
          will be up to the partner to either pass or not pass the card details to
          the hotel. If the hotel does not support a credit or debit card at the time
          of booking, please return a shortened list of the standard supported types
          (MasterCard, Visa).

  RateQualification:
    description: 'The type of qualification required for the room rate.

      Any room rate that is returned without this field populated will default to
      `public`.

      A room rate should only be tagged with a `mobile` rate qualification if the
      price is exclusive to mobile devices.

      When member rates are available, partners should return at least one `public`
      rate and one `member` rate in the API response.

      This feature will only display for qualified partners and has specific UI rules,
      please check with your Tripadvisor account manager for more information.
